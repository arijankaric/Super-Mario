## General info

Developed a Super Mario game using modern C++, the Standard Template Library (STL), and the Win32 API for Windows platform.
Implemented various game mechanics, such as player movement, jumping, collision detection, and physics, using modern C++ features like smart pointers, lambda expressions, and range-based loops.
Utilized the Standard Template Library (STL) to efficiently manage game objects, including dynamic arrays, lists, and maps, for storing game state, game objects, and game assets.
Implemented platformer game elements such as platforms, enemies, power-ups, and coins, with physics-based interactions and animations.
Utilized the Win32 API for Windows platform to handle user input, display graphics, and manage game window, utilizing features such as input handling for player control.
Employed object-oriented programming (OOP) principles for modular and maintainable code, including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, to achieve clean and efficient game logic.
Implemented game logic and mechanics with a focus on performance optimization, leveraging C++17 features, STL algorithms, and efficient data structures to ensure smooth gameplay experience.
Conducted thorough testing and debugging to identify and fix issues, ensuring a stable and bug-free game.
Demonstrated proficiency in moden C++ programming, STL, and Win32 API, as well as game development concepts, including physics, collision detection, and game design principles.
Contributed to all aspects of the game development process, including coding, testing, debugging, and performance optimization, showcasing a strong aptitude for game development with C++ and Windows programming.
This summary highlights the use of modern C++, the Standard Template Library (STL), and the Win32 API in the development of a Super Mario game, along with various game mechanics, optimizations, and contributions made during the development process, showcasing the skills and expertise demonstrated in game development using C++ and Windows programming.

## Video Demonstration

Mario eliminates enemies by jumping on top of them.
The turtle can roll sideways if jumped on twice and eliminate enemies such as other goombas and turtles for Mario

Mario dies when he collides sideways with an enemy.

When Mario is not on the initial ground the camera follows Mario(centers on Mario).
Why? So if there are any projectiles or enemies coming from underneath Mario he can dodge them.
What constitutes initial ground? A ground under which there's no possibility of a sneak attack be it with a fireball or flying goomba.

Flower enemy shoots fireballs at Mario in 1 of 4 possible quadrants that is unless Mario is hiding nearby the flower enemies pipe in which case the flower enemy waits for Mario to come out of hiding

If Mario hits the question box from underneath while in the process of jumping upwards the player receives a coin and the question box becomes empty if that was it's only coin
